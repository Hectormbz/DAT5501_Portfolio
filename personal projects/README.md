These are my personal projects: 
The chelsea code has 3 sections, the first section uses SKlearn and the performance metrics for each chelsea 
season to create a regression to predict chelsea's finish based on the metrics. It then outputs a couple of
values that indicate the accuracy of the predictions. The second section aims to predict chelseas finish in the 
following season based on data from previous seasons. The third section plots a graph of chelsea's finishing 
positions as well as the predicted trend
